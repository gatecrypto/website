          <p className='text-xl text-gray-500'>
            Gate is self-sufficient. While other coins generate revenue from
            large fees, Gate thrives from promoting transactions. Fees are kept
            to a minimum so it is viable for every purchase. The revenue created
            by the network will be used to further grow Gate's capabilities.

            The Gate community is the beating heart of this revolution. This
            project is meant to create opportunities for everyone involved. From
